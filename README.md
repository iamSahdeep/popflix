# Popflix - [Netflix + Popcorntime]

A netflix clone made on Flutter using API provided by [Popcorntime](https://github.com/popcorn-official). State managed using Provider amd will be changing UI soon.

NOTE : Its kind of Torrent client, currently using [flutter_torrent_streamer](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_torrent_streamer) plugin to play Torrent magnet link. This plugin is based on [TorrentStream](https://github.com/TorrentStream/TorrentStream-Android). 

Works only on Android for now. It Still have lots of silly known issues, help me to resolve them by creating issues Or by providing PR's. Any kind of PR is welcome.
